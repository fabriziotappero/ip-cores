For simulation in Cadence IUS8.2 environment:

1. Change the directory to /your_home_path/ds1621/sim
2. Create a link to the simulation top in "sim". The command line is
    ln -s /your_home_path/ds1621
   or
    ln -s /your_home_path/ds1621 ds1621
   or replace the link "ds1621" in "sim.files" with absolute path to the simulation top (ds1621 folder).
3. On the Linux OS command prompt type "./r" (you are in the "sim" folder).
4. The generated output is shown in "ncverilog.log" file.
5. If interested, run simvision to look at the waveforms.
