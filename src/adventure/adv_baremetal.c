"2	You have walked up a hill, still in the forest.  The road slopes back",
"2	down the other side of the hill.  There is a building in the distance.",
"3	You are inside a building, a well house for a large spring.",
"4	You are in a valley in the forest beside a stream tumbling along a",
"4	rocky bed.",
"5	The road, which approaches from the east, ends here amid the trees.",
"6	The forest thins out here to reveal a steep cliff.  There is no way",
"6	down, but a small ledge can be seen to the west across the chasm.",
"7	At your feet all the water of the stream splashes into a 2-inch slit",
"7	in the rock.  Downstream the streambed is bare rock.",
"8	You are in a 20-foot depression floored with bare dirt.  Set into the",
"8	dirt is a strong steel grate mounted in concrete.  A dry streambed",
"8	leads into the depression.",
"9	You are in a small chamber beneath a 3x3 steel grate to the surface.",
"9	A low crawl over cobbles leads inward to the west.",
"10	You are crawling over cobbles in a low passage.  There is a dim light",
"10	at the east end of the passage.",
"11	You are in a debris room filled with stuff washed in from the surface.",
"11	A low wide passage with cobbles becomes plugged with mud and debris",
"11	here, but an awkward canyon leads upward and west.  In the mud someone",
"11	has scrawled, 'MAGIC WORD XYZZY'.",
"12	You are in an awkward sloping east/west canyon.",
"13	You are in a splendid chamber thirty feet high.  The walls are frozen",
"13	rivers of orange stone.  An awkward canyon and a good passage exit",
"13	from east and west sides of the chamber.",
"14	At your feet is a small pit breathing traces of white mist.  An east",
"14	passage ends here except for a small crack leading on.",
"15	You are at one end of a vast hall stretching forward out of sight to",
"15	the west.  There are openings to either side.  Nearby, a wide stone",
"15	staircase leads downward.  The hall is filled with wisps of white mist",
"15	swaying to and fro almost as if alive.  A cold wind blows up the",
"15	staircase.  There is a passage at the top of a dome behind you.",
"16	The crack is far too small for you to follow.  At its widest it is",
"16	barely wide enough to admit your foot.",
"17	You are on the east bank of a fissure slicing clear across the hall.",
"17	The mist is quite thick here, and the fissure is too wide to jump.",
"18	This is a low room with a crude note on the wall.  The note says,",
"18	'You won't get it up the steps'.",
"19	You are in the Hall of the Mountain King, with passages off in all",

"20	You are at the bottom of the pit with a broken neck.",
"21	You didn't make it.",
"22	The dome is unclimbable.",

"24	You are at the bottom of the eastern pit in the Twopit Room.  There is",
"24	a small pool of oil in one corner of the pit.",
"25	You are at the bottom of the western pit in the Twopit Room.  There is",

"26	You clamber up the plant and scurry through the hole at the top.",
"27	You are on the west side of the fissure in the Hall of Mists.",

"32	You can't get by the snake.",
"33	You are in a large room, with a passage to the south, a passage to the",
"33	west, and a wall of broken rock to the east.  There is a large 'Y2' on",
"33	a rock in the room's center.",
"34	You are in a jumble of rock, with cracks everywhere.",
"35	You're at a low window overlooking a huge pit, which extends up out of",
"35	sight.  A floor is indistinctly visible over 50 feet below.  Traces of",
"35	white mist cover the floor of the pit, becoming thicker to the right.",
"35	Marks in the dust around the window would seem to indicate that",
"35	someone has been here recently.  Directly across the pit from you and",
"35	25 feet away there is a similar window looking into a lighted room.  A",
"35	shadowy figure can be seen there peering back at you.",
"36	You are in a dirty broken passage.  To the east is a crawl.  To the",
"36	west is a large passage.  Above you is a hole to another passage.",
"37	You are on the brink of a small clean climbable pit.  A crawl leads",
"37	west.",
"38	You are in the bottom of a small pit with a little stream, which",
"38	enters and exits through tiny slits.",
"39	You are in a large room full of dusty rocks.  There is a big hole in",
"39	the floor.  There are cracks everywhere, and a passage leading east.",
"40	You have crawled through a very low wide passage parallel to and north",
"40	of the Hall of Mists.",
"41	You are at the west end of the Hall of Mists.  A low wide crawl",

"58	Dead end",
"59	You have crawled through a very low wide passage parallel to and north",
"59	of the Hall of Mists.",
"60	You are at the east end of a very long hall apparently without side",

"61	You are at the west end of a very long featureless hall.  The hall",
"61	joins up with a narrow north/south passage.",
"62	You are at a crossover of a high n/s passage and a low e/w one.",
"63	Dead end",
"64	You are at a complex junction.  A low hands and knees passage from the",
"64	north joins a higher crawl from the east to make a walking passage",
"64	going west.  There is also a large room above.  The air is damp here.",
"65	You are in Bedquilt, a long east/west passage with holes everywhere.",
"65	To explore at random select north, south, up, or down.",
"66	You are in a room whose walls resemble swiss cheese.  Obvious passages",
"66	go west, east, ne, and nw.  Part of the room is occupied by a large",
"66	bedrock block.",
"67	You are at the east end of the Twopit Room.  The floor here is",
"67	littered with thin rock slabs, which make it easy to descend the pits.",
"67	There is a path here bypassing the pits to connect passages from east",
"67	and west.  There are holes all over, but the only big one is on the",
"67	wall directly over the west pit where you can't get to it.",
"68	You are in a large low circular chamber whose floor is an immense slab",
"68	fallen from the ceiling (Slab Room).  East and west there once were",
"68	large passages, but they are now filled with boulders.  Low small",
"68	passages go north and south, and the south one quickly bends west",
"68	around the boulders.",
"69	You are in a secret n/s canyon above a large room.",
"70	You are in a secret n/s canyon above a sizable passage.",
"71	You are in a secret canyon at a junction of three canyons, bearing",

"72	You are in a large low room.  Crawls lead north, se, and sw.",
"73	Dead end crawl.",
"74	You are in a secret canyon which here runs e/w.  It crosses over a",
"74	very tight canyon 15 feet below.  If you go down you may not be able",
"74	to get back up.",
"75	You are at a wide place in a very tight n/s canyon.",
"76	The canyon here becomes too tight to go further south.",
"77	You are in a tall e/w canyon.  A low tight crawl goes 3 feet north and",
"77	seems to open up.",
"78	The canyon runs into a mass of boulders -- dead end.",
"79	The stream flows out through a pair of 1 foot diameter sewer pipes.",
"79	It would be advisable to use the exit.",

"87	You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike.",
"88	You are in a long, narrow corridor stretching out of sight to the",
"88	west.  At the eastern end is a hole through which you can see a",
"88	profusion of leaves.",
"89	There is nothing here to climb.  Use 'up' or 'out' to leave the pit.",
"90	You have climbed up the plant and out of the pit.",
"91	You are at the top of a steep incline above a large room.  You could",
"91	climb down here, but you would not be able to climb up.  There is a",
"91	passage leading back to the north.",
"92	You are in the Giant Room.  The ceiling here is too high up for your",
"92	lamp to show it.  Cavernous passages lead east, north, and south.  On",
"92	the west wall is scrawled the inscription, 'FEE FIE FOE FOO' [sic].",
"93	The passage here is blocked by a recent cave-in.",
"94	You are at one end of an immense north/south passage.",
"95	You are in a magnificent cavern with a rushing stream, which cascades",
"95	over a sparkling waterfall into a roaring whirlpool which disappears",
"95	through a hole in the floor.  Passages exit to the south and west.",
"96	You are in the Soft Room.  The walls are covered with heavy curtains,",
"96	the floor with a thick pile carpet.  Moss covers the ceiling.",
"97	This is the Oriental Room.  Ancient oriental cave drawings cover the",
"97	walls.  A gently sloping passage leads upward to the north, another",
"97	passage leads se, and a hands and knees crawl leads west.",
"98	You are following a wide path around the outer edge of a large cavern.",
"98	Far below, through a heavy white mist, strange splashing noises can be",
"98	heard.  The mist rises up through a fissure in the ceiling.  The path",
"98	exits to the south and west.",
"99	You are in an alcove.  A small nw path seems to widen after a short",
"99	distance.  An extremely tight tunnel leads east.  It looks like a very",
"99	tight squeeze.  An eerie light can be seen at the other end.",
"100	You're in a small chamber lit by an eerie green light.  An extremely",
"100	narrow tunnel exits to the west.  A dark corridor leads ne.",
"101	You're in the dark-room.  A corridor leading south is the only exit.",
"102	You are in an arched hall.  A coral passage once continued up and east",
"102	from here, but is now blocked by debris.  The air smells of sea water.",
"103	You're in a large room carved out of sedimentary rock.  The floor and",
"103	walls are littered with bits of shells imbedded in the stone.  A",
"103	shallow passage proceeds downward, and a somewhat steeper one leads",
"103	up.  A low hands and knees passage enters from the south.",
"104	You are in a long sloping corridor with ragged sharp walls.",
"105	You are in a cul-de-sac about eight feet across.",
"106	You are in an anteroom leading to a large passage to the east.  Small",
"106	passages go west and up.  The remnants of recent digging are evident.",
"106	A sign in midair here says 'Cave under construction beyond this point.",
"106	Proceed at own risk.  [Witt Construction Company]'",
"107	You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all different.",
"108	You are at Witt's End.  Passages lead off in *ALL* directions.",
"109	You are in a north/south canyon about 25 feet across.  The floor is",
"109	covered by white mist seeping in from the north.  The walls extend",
"109	upward for well over 100 feet.  Suspended from some unseen point far",
"109	above you, an enormous two-sided mirror is hanging parallel to and",
"109	midway between the canyon walls.  (The mirror is obviously provided",
"109	for the use of the dwarves who, as you know, are extremely vain.)  A",
"109	small window can be seen in either wall, some fifty feet up.",
"110	You're at a low window overlooking a huge pit, which extends up out of",
"110	sight.  A floor is indistinctly visible over 50 feet below.  Traces of",
"110	white mist cover the floor of the pit, becoming thicker to the left.",
"110	Marks in the dust around the window would seem to indicate that",
"110	someone has been here recently.  Directly across the pit from you and",
"110	25 feet away there is a similar window looking into a lighted room.  A",
"110	shadowy figure can be seen there peering back at you.",
"111	A large stalactite extends from the roof and almost reaches the floor",
"111	below.  You could climb down it, and jump from it to the floor, but",
"111	having done so you would be unable to reach it to climb back up.",
"112	You are in a little maze of twisting passages, all different.",
"113	You are at the edge of a large underground reservoir.  An opaque cloud",
"113	of white mist fills the room and rises rapidly upward.  The lake is",
"113	fed by a stream, which tumbles out of a hole in the wall about 10 feet",
"113	overhead and splashes noisily into the water somewhere within the",
"113	mist.  There is a passage going back toward the south.",
"114	Dead end",
"115	You are at the northeast end of an immense room, even larger than the",
"115	Giant Room.  It appears to be a repository for the 'Adventure'",
"115	program.  Massive torches far overhead bathe the room with smoky",
"115	yellow light.  Scattered about you can be seen a pile of bottles (all",
"115	of them empty), a nursery of young beanstalks murmuring quietly, a bed",
"115	of oysters, a bundle of black rods with rusty stars on their ends, and",
"115	a collection of brass lanterns.  Off to one side a great many dwarves",
"115	are sleeping on the floor, snoring loudly.  A notice nearby reads: 'Do",
"115	not disturb the dwarves!'  An immense mirror is hanging against one",
"115	wall, and stretches to the other end of the room, where various other",
"115	sundry objects can be glimpsed dimly in the distance.",
"116	You are at the southwest end of the repository.  To one side is a pit",
"116	full of fierce green snakes.  On the other side is a row of small",
"116	wicker cages, each of which contains a little sulking bird.  In one",
"116	corner is a bundle of black rods with rusty marks on their ends.  A",
"116	large number of velvet pillows are scattered about on the floor.  A",
"116	vast mirror stretches off to the northeast.  At your feet is a large",
"116	steel grate, next to which is a sign that reads, 'Treasure Vault.",
"116	Keys in main office.'",
"117	You are on one side of a large, deep chasm.  A heavy white mist rising",
"117	up from below obscures all view of the far side.  A sw path leads away",
"117	from the chasm into a winding corridor.",
"118	You are in a long winding corridor sloping out of sight in both",
"118	directions.",
"119	You are in a secret canyon which exits to the north and east.",
"120	You are in a secret canyon which exits to the north and east.",
"121	You are in a secret canyon which exits to the north and east.",
"122	You are on the far side of the chasm.  A ne path leads away from the",
"122	chasm on this side.",
"123	You're in a long east/west corridor.  A faint rumbling noise can be",
"123	heard in the distance.",
"124	The path forks here.  The left fork leads northeast.  A dull rumbling",
"124	seems to get louder in that direction.  The right fork leads southeast",
"124	down a gentle slope.  The main corridor enters from the west.",
"125	The walls are quite warm here.  From the north can be heard a steady",
"125	roar, so loud that the entire cave seems to be trembling.  Another",
"125	passage leads south, and a low crawl goes east.",
"126	You are on the edge of a breath-taking view.  Far below you is an",
"126	active volcano, from which great gouts of molten lava come surging",
"126	out, cascading back down into the depths.  The glowing rock fills the",
"126	farthest reaches of the cavern with a blood-red glare, giving every-",
"126	thing an eerie, macabre appearance.  The air is filled with flickering",
"126	sparks of ash and a heavy smell of brimstone.  The walls are hot to",
"126	the touch, and the thundering of the volcano drowns out all other",
"126	sounds.  Embedded in the jagged roof far overhead are myriad twisted",
"126	formations composed of pure white alabaster, which scatter the murky",
"126	light into sinister apparitions upon the walls.  To one side is a deep",
"126	gorge, filled with a bizarre chaos of tortured rock which seems to",
"126	have been crafted by the devil himself.  An immense river of fire",
"126	crashes out from the depths of the volcano, burns its way through the",
"126	gorge, and plummets into a bottomless pit far off to your left.  To",
"126	the right, an immense geyser of blistering steam erupts continuously",
"126	from a barren island in the center of a sulfurous lake, which bubbles",
"126	ominously.  The far right wall is aflame with an incandescence of its",
"126	own, which lends an additional infernal splendor to the already",
"126	hellish scene.  A dark, foreboding passage exits to the south.",
"127	You are in a small chamber filled with large boulders.  The walls are",
"127	very warm, causing the air in the room to be almost stifling from the",
"127	heat.  The only exit is a crawl heading west, through which is coming",
"127	a low rumbling.",
"128	You are walking along a gently sloping north/south passage lined with",
"128	oddly shaped limestone formations.",
"129	You are standing at the entrance to a large, barren room.  A notice",
"129	above the entrance reads:  'Caution!  Bear in room!'",
"130	You are inside a barren room.  The center of the room is completely",
"130	empty except for some dust.  Marks in the dust lead away toward the",
"130	far end of the room.  The only exit is the way you came in.",

"167	surrounded by forest.",
"168	You are walking across the bottom of the reservoir.  Walls of water",
"168	rear up on either side.  The roar of the water cascading past is",
"168	nearly deafening, and the mist is so thick you can barely see.",
"169	You are at the northern edge of the reservoir.  A northwest passage",
"169	leads sharply up from here.",
"170	You are scrambling along a treacherously steep, rocky passage.",
"171	You are on a very steep incline, which widens at it goes upward.",
"172	You are at the base of a nearly vertical cliff.  There are some",
"172	slim footholds which would enable you to climb up, but it looks",
"172	extremely dangerous.  Here at the base of the cliff lie the remains",
"172	of several earlier adventurers who apparently failed to make it.",

"174	Just as you reach the top, your foot slips on a loose rock and you",
"174	tumble several hundred feet to join the other unlucky adventurers.",
"175	Just as you reach the top, your foot slips on a loose rock and you",
"175	make one last desperate grab.  Your luck holds, as does your grip.",
"175	With an enormous heave, you lift yourself to the ledge above.",
"176	You are on a small ledge at the top of a nearly vertical cliff.",
"176	There is a low crawl leading off to the northeast.",

"14	I'm game.  Would you care to explain how?",
"15	Sorry, but I am not allowed to give more detail.  I will repeat the",

"16	It is now pitch dark.  If you proceed you will likely fall into a pit.",
"17	If you prefer, simply type w rather than west.",
"18	Are you trying to catch the bird?",
"19	Something about you seems to be frightening the bird.  Perhaps you",
"19	might figure out what it is.",
"20	Are you trying to somehow deal with the snake?",
"21	You can't kill the snake, or drive it away, or avoid it, or anything",
"21	like that.  There is a way to get by, but you don't have the necessary",
"21	resources right now.",
"22	Do you really want to quit now?",
"23	You fell into a pit and broke every bone in your body!",
"24	You are already carrying it!",
"25	You can't be serious!",
"26	The bird seemed unafraid at first, but as you approach it becomes",
"26	disturbed and you cannot catch it.",
"27	You can catch the bird, but you cannot carry it.",
"28	There is nothing here with a lock!",
"29	You aren't carrying it!",
"30	The little bird attacks the green snake, and in an astounding flurry",
"30	drives the snake away.",
"31	You have no keys!",
"32	It has no lock.",

"39	Your lamp is now on.",
"40	Your lamp is now off.",
"41	There is no way to get past the bear to unlock the chain, which is",
"41	probably just as well.",
"42	Nothing happens.",
"43	Where?",
"44	There is nothing here to attack.",
"45	The little bird is now dead.  Its body disappears.",
"46	Attacking the snake both doesn't work and is very dangerous.",
"47	You killed a little dwarf.",
"48	You attack a little dwarf, but he dodges out of the way.",
"49	With what?  Your bare hands?",
"50	Good try, but that is an old worn-out magic word.",
"51	I know of places, actions, and things.  Most of my vocabulary",
"51	describes places and is used to move you there.  To move, try words",
"51	like forest, building, downstream, enter, east, west, north, south,",
"51	up, or down.  I know about a few special objects, like a black rod",
"51	hidden in the cave.  These objects can be manipulated using some of",
"51	the action words that I know.  Usually you will need to give both the",
"51	object and action words (in either order), but sometimes I can infer",
"51	the object from the verb alone.  Some objects also imply verbs; in",
"51	particular, 'inventory' implies 'take inventory', which causes me to",
"51	give you a list of what you're carrying.  Some objects have unexpected",
"51	effects; the effects are not always desirable!  Usually people having",
"51	trouble moving just need to try a few more words.  Usually people",
"51	trying unsuccessfully to manipulate an object are attempting something",
"51	beyond their (or my!) capabilities and should try a completely",
"51	different tack.  One point often confusing to beginners is that, when",
"51	there are several ways to go in a certain direction (e.g., if there",
"51	are several holes in a wall), choosing that direction in effect",
"51	chooses one of the ways at random; often, though, by specifying the",
"51	place you want to reach you can guarantee choosing the right path.",
"51	Also, to speed the game you can sometimes move long distances with a",
"51	single word.  For example, 'building' usually gets you to the building",
"51	from anywhere above ground except when lost in the forest.  Also, note",
"51	that cave passages and forest paths turn a lot, so leaving one place",
"51	heading north doesn't guarantee entering the next from the south.",
"51	However (another important point), except when you've used a 'long",
"51	distance' word such as 'building', there is always a way to go back",
"51	where you just came from unless I warn you to the contrary, even",
"51	though the direction that takes you back might not be the reverse of",
"51	what got you here.  Good luck, and have fun!",
"52	There is no way to go that direction.",
"53	Please stick to 1- and 2-word commands.",
"54	OK",
"55	You can't unlock the keys.",
"56	You have crawled around in some little holes and wound up back in the",
"56	main passage.",
"57	I don't know where the cave is, but hereabouts no stream can run on",
"57	the surface for long.  I would try the stream.",
"58	I need more detailed instructions to do that.",
"59	I can only tell you what you see as you move about and manipulate",
"59	things.  I cannot tell you where remote things are.",
"60	The ogre snarls and shoves you back.",
"61	Huh?",
"62	Are you trying to get into the cave?",
"63	The grate is very solid and has a hardened steel lock.  You cannot",
"63	enter without a key, and there are no keys nearby.  I would recommend",
"63	looking elsewhere for the keys.",
"64	The trees of the forest are large hardwood oak and maple, with an",
"64	occasional grove of pine or spruce.  There is quite a bit of under-",
"64	growth, largely birch and ash saplings plus nondescript bushes of",
"64	various sorts.  This time of year visibility is quite restricted by",
"64	all the leaves, but travel is quite easy if you detour around the",
"64	spruce and berry bushes.",
"65	Welcome to Adventure!!  Would you like instructions?",
"66	Digging without a shovel is quite impractical.  Even with a shovel",
"66	progress is unlikely.",
"67	Blasting requires dynamite.",
"68	I'm as confused as you are.",
"69	Mist is a white vapor, usually water, seen from time to time in",
"69	caverns.  It can be found anywhere but is frequently a sign of a deep",
"69	pit leading down to water.",
"70	Your feet are now wet.",
"71	I think I just lost my appetite.",
"72	Thank you, it was delicious!",
"73	You have taken a drink from the stream.  The water tastes strongly of",
"73	minerals, but is not unpleasant.  It is extremely cold.",
"74	The bottle of water is now empty.",
"75	Rubbing the electric lamp is not particularly rewarding.  Anyway,",
"75	nothing exciting happens.",
"76	Peculiar.  Nothing unexpected happens.",
"77	Your bottle is empty and the ground is wet.",
"78	You can't pour that.",
"79	Watch it!",
"80	Which way?",
"81	Oh dear, you seem to have gotten yourself killed.  I might be able to",
"81	help you out, but I've never really done this before.  Do you want me",
"81	to try to reincarnate you?",
"82	All right.  But don't blame me if something goes wr......",
"82	                    --- POOF!! ---",
"82	You are engulfed in a cloud of orange smoke.  Coughing and gasping,",
"82	you emerge from the smoke and find....",
"83	You clumsy oaf, you've done it again!  I don't know how long I can",
"83	keep this up.  Do you want me to try reincarnating you again?",
"84	Okay, now where did I put my orange smoke?....  >POOF!<",
"84	Everything disappears in a dense cloud of orange smoke.",
"85	Now you've really done it!  I'm out of orange smoke!  You don't expect",
"85	me to do a decent reincarnation without any orange smoke, do you?",
"86	Okay, if you're so smart, do it yourself!  I'm leaving!",
"90	>>> messages 81 thru 90 are reserved for 'obituaries'. <<<",
"91	Sorry, but I no longer seem to remember how it was you got here.",
"92	You can't carry anything more.  You'll have to drop something first.",
"93	You can't go through a locked steel grate!",
"94	I believe what you want is right here with you.",
"95	You don't fit through a two-inch slit!",
"96	I respectfully suggest you go across the bridge instead of jumping.",
"97	There is no way across the fissure.",
"98	You're not carrying anything.",
"99	You are currently holding the following:",
"100	It's not hungry (it's merely pinin' for the fjords).  Besides, you",
"100	have no bird seed.",
"101	The snake has now devoured your bird.",
"102	There's nothing here it wants to eat (except perhaps you).",
"103	You fool, dwarves eat only coal!  Now you've made him *REALLY* mad!!",
"104	You have nothing in which to carry it.",
"105	Your bottle is already full.",
"106	There is nothing here with which to fill the bottle.",
"107	Your bottle is now full of water.",
"108	Your bottle is now full of oil.",
"109	You can't fill that.",
"110	Don't be ridiculous!",
"111	The door is extremely rusty and refuses to open.",
"112	The plant indignantly shakes the oil off its leaves and asks, 'Water?'",
"113	The hinges are quite thoroughly rusted now and won't budge.",
"114	The oil has freed up the hinges so that the door will now move,",
"114	although it requires some effort.",
"115	The plant has exceptionally deep roots and cannot be pulled free.",
"116	The dwarves' knives vanish as they strike the walls of the cave.",
"117	Something you're carrying won't fit through the tunnel with you.",
"117	You'd best take inventory and drop something.",
"118	You can't fit this five-foot clam through that little passage!",
"119	You can't fit this five-foot oyster through that little passage!",
"120	I advise you to put down the clam before opening it.  >STRAIN!<",
"121	I advise you to put down the oyster before opening it.  >WRENCH!<",
"122	You don't have anything strong enough to open the clam.",
"123	You don't have anything strong enough to open the oyster.",
"124	A glistening pearl falls out of the clam and rolls away.  Goodness,",
"124	this must really be an oyster.  (I never was very good at identifying",
"124	bivalves.)  Whatever it is, it has now snapped shut again.",
"125	The oyster creaks open, revealing nothing but oyster inside.  It",
"125	promptly snaps shut again.",
"126	You have crawled around in some little holes and found your way",
"126	blocked by a recent cave-in.  You are now back in the main passage.",
"127	There are faint rustling noises from the darkness behind you.",
"128	Out from the shadows behind you pounces a bearded pirate!  'Har, har,'",
"128	he chortles, 'I'll just take all this booty and hide it away with me",
"128	chest deep in the maze!'  He snatches your treasure and vanishes into",
"128	the gloom.",
"129	A sepulchral voice reverberating through the cave, says, 'Cave closing",
"129	soon.  All adventurers exit immediately through main office.'",
"130	A mysterious recorded voice groans into life and announces:",
"130	   'This exit is closed.  Please leave via main office.'",
"131	It looks as though you're dead.  Well, seeing as how it's so close to",
"131	closing time anyway, I think we'll just call it a day.",
"132	The sepulchral voice intones, 'The cave is now closed.'  As the echoes",
"132	fade, there is a blinding flash of light (and a small puff of orange",
"132	smoke). . . .    As your eyes refocus, you look around and find...",
"133	There is a loud explosion, and a twenty-foot hole appears in the far",
"133	wall, burying the dwarves in the rubble.  You march through the hole",
"133	and find yourself in the main office, where a cheering band of",
"133	friendly elves carry the conquering adventurer off into the sunset.",
"134	There is a loud explosion, and a twenty-foot hole appears in the far",
"134	wall, burying the snakes in the rubble.  A river of molten lava pours",
"134	in through the hole, destroying everything in its path, including you!",
"135	There is a loud explosion, and you are suddenly splashed across the",
"135	walls of the room.",
"136	The resulting ruckus has awakened the dwarves.  There are now several",
"136	threatening little dwarves in the room with you!  Most of them throw",
"136	knives at you!  All of them get you!",
"137	Oh, leave the poor unhappy bird alone.",
"138	I daresay whatever you want is around here somewhere.",
"139	I don't know the word 'stop'.  Use 'quit' if you want to give up.",
"140	You can't get there from here.",
"141	You are being followed by a very large, tame bear.",
"142	For a summary of the most recent changes to the game, say 'news'.",
"142	If you want to end your adventure early, say 'quit'.  To suspend your",
"142	adventure such that you can continue later, say 'suspend' (or 'pause'",
"142	or 'save').  To see how well you're doing, say 'score'.  To get full",
"142	credit for a treasure, you must have left it safely in the building,",
"142	though you get partial credit just for locating it.  You lose points",
"142	for getting killed, or for quitting, though the former costs you more.",
"142	There are also points based on how much (if any) of the cave you've",
"142	managed to explore; in particular, there is a large bonus just for",
"142	getting in (to distinguish the beginners from the rest of the pack),",
"142	and there are other ways to determine whether you've been through some",
"142	of the more harrowing sections.  If you think you've found all the",
"142	treasures, just keep exploring for a while.  If nothing interesting",
"142	happens, you haven't found them all yet.  If something interesting",
"142	*DOES* happen (incidentally, there *ARE* ways to hasten things along),",
"142	it means you're getting a bonus and have an opportunity to garner many",
"142	more points in the Master's section.  I may occasionally offer hints",
"142	if you seem to be having trouble.  If I do, I'll warn you in advance",
"142	how much it will affect your score to accept the hints.  Finally, to",
"142	save time, you may specify 'brief', which tells me never to repeat the",
"142	full description of a place unless you explicitly ask me to.",
"143	Now let's see you do it without suspending in mid-Adventure.",
"144	There is nothing here with which to fill it.",
"145	The sudden change in temperature has delicately shattered the vase.",
"146	It is beyond your power to do that.",
"147	I don't know how.",
"148	It is too far up for you to reach.",
"149	You killed a little dwarf.  The body vanishes in a cloud of greasy",
"149	black smoke.",
"150	The shell is very strong and is impervious to attack.",
"151	What's the matter, can't you read?  Now you'd best start over.",
"152	The axe bounces harmlessly off the dragon's thick scales.",
"153	The dragon looks rather nasty.  You'd best not try to get by.",
"154	The little bird attacks the green dragon, and in an astounding flurry",
"154	gets burnt to a cinder.  The ashes blow away.",
"155	On what?",
"156	Okay, from now on I'll only describe a place in full the first time",
"156	you come to it.  To get the full description, say 'look'.",
"157	Trolls are close relatives with the rocks and have skin as tough as",
"157	that of a rhinoceros.  The troll fends off your blows effortlessly.",
"158	The troll deftly catches the axe, examines it carefully, and tosses it",
"158	back, declaring, 'Good workmanship, but it's not valuable enough.'",
"159	The troll catches your treasure and scurries away out of sight.",
"160	The troll refuses to let you cross.",
"161	There is no longer any way across the chasm.",
"162	Just as you reach the other side, the bridge buckles beneath the",
"162	weight of the bear, which was still following you around.  You",
"162	scrabble desperately for support, but as the bridge collapses you",
"162	stumble back and fall into the chasm.",
"163	The bear lumbers toward the troll, who lets out a startled shriek and",
"163	scurries away.  The bear soon gives up the pursuit and wanders back.",
"164	The axe misses and lands near the bear where you can't get at it.",
"165	With what?  Your bare hands?  Against *HIS* bear hands??",
"166	The bear is confused; he only wants to be your friend.",
"167	For crying out loud, the poor thing is already dead!",
"168	The bear eagerly wolfs down your food, after which he seems to calm",
"168	down considerably and even becomes rather friendly.",
"169	The bear is still chained to the wall.",
"170	The chain is still locked.",
"171	The chain is now unlocked.",
"172	The chain is now locked.",
"173	There is nothing here to which the chain can be locked.",
"174	There is nothing here to eat.",
"175	Do you want the hint?",
"176	Do you need help getting out of the maze?",
"177	You can make the passages look less alike by dropping things.",
"178	Are you trying to explore beyond the plover room?",
"179	There is a way to explore that region without having to worry about",
"179	falling into a pit.  None of the objects available is immediately",
"179	useful in discovering the secret.",
"180	Do you need help getting out of here?",
"181	Don't go west.",
"182	Gluttony is not one of the troll's vices.  Avarice, however, is.",
"183	Your lamp is getting dim.  You'd best start wrapping this up, unless",
"183	you can find some fresh batteries.  I seem to recall there's a vending",
"183	machine in the maze.  Bring some coins with you.",
"184	Your lamp has run out of power.",
"185	Please answer the question.",
"186	There are faint rustling noises from the darkness behind you.  As you",
"186	turn toward them, the beam of your lamp falls across a bearded pirate.",
"186	He is carrying a large chest.  'Shiver me timbers!' he cries, 'I've",
"186	been spotted!  I'd best hie meself off to the maze to hide me chest!'",
"186	With that, he vanishes into the gloom.",
"187	Your lamp is getting dim.  You'd best go back for those batteries.",
"188	Your lamp is getting dim.  I'm taking the liberty of replacing the",
"188	batteries.",
"189	Your lamp is getting dim, and you're out of spare batteries.  You'd",
"189	best start wrapping this up.",
"190	You sift your fingers through the dust, but succeed only in",
"190	obliterating the cryptic message.",
"191	Do you need help dealing with the ogre?",
"192	Hmmm, this looks like a clue, which means it'll cost you 10 points to",
"192	read it.  Should I go ahead and read it anyway?",
"193	It says, 'There is a way out of this place.  Do you need any more",
"193	information to escape?  Sorry, but this initial hint is all you get.'",
"194	There is nothing the presence of which will prevent you from defeating",
"194	him; thus it can't hurt to fetch everything you possibly can.",
"195	I'm afraid I don't understand.",
"196	Your hand passes through it as though it weren't there.",
"197	You strike the mirror a resounding blow, whereupon it shatters into a",
"197	myriad tiny fragments.",
"198	You have taken the vase and hurled it delicately to the ground.",
"199	You prod the nearest dwarf, who wakes up grumpily, takes one look at",
"199	you, curses, and grabs for his axe.",
"200	Is this acceptable?",
"201	This adventure is already over.  To start a new adventure, or to",
"201	resume an earlier adventure, please run a fresh copy of the program.",
"202	The ogre doesn't appear to be hungry.",
"203	The ogre, who despite his bulk is quite agile, easily dodges your",
"203	attack.  He seems almost amused by your puny effort.",
"204	The ogre, distracted by your rush, is struck by the knife.  With a",
"204	blood-curdling yell he turns and bounds after the dwarves, who flee",
"204	in panic.  You are left alone in the room.",
"205	The ogre, distracted by your rush, is struck by the knife.  With a",
"205	blood-curdling yell he turns and bounds after the dwarf, who flees",
"205	in panic.  You are left alone in the room.",
"206	The bird flies about agitatedly for a moment.",
"207	The bird flies agitatedly about the cage.",
"208	The bird flies about agitatedly for a moment, then disappears through",
"208	the crack.  It reappears shortly, carrying in its beak a jade",
"208	necklace, which it drops at your feet.",
"209	The urn is now lit.",
"210	The urn is now dark.",
"211	You empty the bottle into the urn, which promptly ejects the water",
"211	with uncanny accuracy, squirting you directly between the eyes.",
"212	Your bottle is now empty and the urn is full of oil.",
"213	The urn is already full of oil.",
"214	There's no way to get the oil out of the urn.",
"215	The urn is far too firmly embedded for your puny strength to budge it.",
"216	As you rub the urn, there is a flash of light and a genie appears.",
"216	His aspect is stern as he advises: 'One who wouldst traffic in",
"216	precious stones must first learn to recognize the signals thereof.'",
"216	He wrests the urn from the stone, leaving a small cavity.  Turning to",
"216	face you again, he fixes you with a steely eye and intones: 'Caution!'",
"216	Genie and urn vanish in a cloud of amber smoke.  The smoke condenses",
"216	to form a rare amber gemstone, resting in the cavity in the rock.",
"217	I suppose you collect doughnut holes, too?",
"218	The gem fits easily into the cavity.",
"219	The persian rug stiffens and rises a foot or so off the ground.",
"220	The persian rug draped over your shoulder seems to wriggle for a",
"220	moment, but then subsides.",
"221	The persian rug settles gently to the ground.",
"222	The rug hovers stubbornly where it is.",
"223	The rug does not appear inclined to cooperate.",
"224	If you mean to use the persian rug, it does not appear inclined to",
"224	cooperate.",
"225	Though you flap your arms furiously, it is to no avail.",
"226	You board the persian rug, which promptly whisks you across the chasm.",
"226	You have time for a fleeting glimpse of a two thousand foot drop to a",
"226	mighty river; then you find yourself on the other side.",
"227	The rug ferries you back across the chasm.",
"228	All is silent.",
"229	The stream is gurgling placidly.",
"230	The wind whistles coldly past your ears.",
"231	The stream splashes loudly into the pool.",
"232	You are unable to make anything of the splashing noise.",
"233	You can hear the murmuring of the beanstalks and the snoring of the",
"233	dwarves.",
"234	A loud hissing emanates from the snake pit.",
"235	The air is filled with a dull rumbling sound.",
"236	The roar is quite loud here.",
"237	The roaring is so loud that it drowns out all other sound.",
"238	The bird eyes you suspiciously and flutters away.  A moment later you",
"238	feel something wet land on your head, but upon looking up you can see",
"238	no sign of the culprit.",
"239	There are only a few drops--not enough to carry.",
"240	Your head buzzes strangely for a moment.",
"241	(Uh, y'know, that wasn't very bright.)",
"242	It's a pity you took so long about it.",
"243	Are you wondering what to do here?",
"244	This section is quite advanced.  Find the cave first.",
"245	Upstream or downstream?",
"246	Wizards are not to be disturbed by such as you.",
"247	Would you like to be shown out of the forest?",
"248	Go east ten times.  If that doesn't get you out, then go south, then",
"248	west twice, then south.",
"249	The waters are crashing loudly against the shore.",
"250	%1 of them throw knives at you!",
"251	%1 of them get you!",
"252	One of them gets you!",
"253	None of them hits you!",
"254	Sorry, I don't know the word '%W'.",
"255	What do you want to do with the %L?",
"256	I see no %L here.",
"257	%C what?",
"258	Okay, '%W'.",
"259	You have garnered %3 out of a possible %3 points, using %5 turn%S.",
"260	I can suspend your Adventure for you so that you can resume later, but",
"260	it will cost you 5 points.",
"261	I am prepared to give you a hint, but it will cost you %1 point%S.",
"262	You scored %3 out of a possible %3, using%5 turn%S.",
"263	To achieve the next higher rating, you need %2 more point%S.",
"264	To achieve the next higher rating would be a neat trick!",
"264	Congratulations!!",
"265	You just went off my scale!!",
"266	To resume your Adventure, start a new game and then say 'RESUME'.",
"267	Table space used:",
"267	%6 of %6 words of messages   %6 of %6 travel options",
"267	%6 of %6 vocabulary words    %6 of %6 locations",
"267	%6 of %6 objects             %6 of %6 action verbs",
"267	%6 of %6 'random' messages   %6 of %6 'class' messages",
"267	%6 of %6 hints               %6 of %6 turn threshholds",
"268	To resume an earlier Adventure, you must abandon the current one.",
"269	I'm sorry, but that Adventure was begun using Version%2.%1 of the",
"269	program, and this is Version%2.%1.  You must find the other version",
"269	in order to resume that Adventure.",
"270	A dark fog creeps in to surround you.  From somewhere in the fog you",
"270	hear a stern voice.  'This Adventure has been tampered with!  You have",
"270	been dabbling in magic, knowing not the havoc you might cause thereby.",
"270	Leave at once, before you do irrevocable harm!'  The fog thickens,",
"270	until at last you can see nothing at all.  Your vision then clears,",
"270	and you find yourself back in The Real World.",
"271	Guess again.",
"272	You're missing only one other treasure.  Do you need help finding it?",
"273	Once you've found all the other treasures, it is no longer possible to",
"273	locate the one you're now missing.",
"274	Sorry, but the path twisted and turned so much that I can't figure",
"274	out which way to go to get back.",
"275	Version 2.5 is essentially the same as Version II; the cave and the",
"275	hazards therein are unchanged, and top score is still 430 points.",
"275	There are a few more hints, especially for some of the more obscure",
"275	puzzles.  There are a few minor bugfixes and cosmetic changes.  You",
"275	can now save a game and resume it at once (formerly you had to wait a",
"275	while first), but it now costs you a few points each time you save the",
"275	game.  Saved games are now stored in much smaller files than before.",
"276	You don't have to say 'go' every time; just specify a direction or, if",
"276	it's nearby, name the place to which you wish to move.",
