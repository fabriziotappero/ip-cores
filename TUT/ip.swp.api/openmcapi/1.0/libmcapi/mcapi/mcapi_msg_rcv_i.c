*   FUNCTION
*
*       mcapi_msg_recv_i
*
*   DESCRIPTION
*
*       Non-blocking API routine to receive a connectionless message on a
*       local endpoint.
*
*   INPUTS
*
*       receive_endpoint        The local endpoint identifer that is
*                               receiving the data.
*       *buffer                 A pointer to memory that will be filled in
*                               with the received data.
*       buffer_size             The number of bytes that will fit in *buffer.
*       *request                A pointer to memory that will be filled in
*                               with data relevant to the operation, so the
*                               status of the operation can later be checked.
*       *mcapi_status           A pointer to memory that will be filled in
*                               with the status of the call.
*
*   OUTPUTS
*
*       None.
