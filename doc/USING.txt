1. SETUP:
---------

To use the Grain IP, first instantiate the VHDL entity in your design:


	grain0: entity work.grain
	generic map ( 
		DEBUG => false,
		FAST  => false
	)
	port map (
		CLK_I    => clk,
		CLKEN_I  => clken,
		ARESET_I => areset,
	
		KEY_I  => key_in,
		IV_I   => iv_in,
		INIT_I => init,
		
		KEYSTREAM_O       => keystream,
		KEYSTREAM_VALID_O => keystream_valid
	);
	

Notice that this entity requires a clock, an asynchronous reset and an 
(optional) clock enable.

You also need to add the grain implementation files to your project:
  - "grain.vhd" 
  - "grain_datapath_fast.vhd"
  - "grain_datapath_slow.vhd"

Notice that only one of the datapath files will be used (depending 
on the value of the "FAST" generic parameter).





2. INITIALIZATION:
------------------

To start the stream cipher, you must supply it with a key and an IV. 
In the case of Grain-1, these are 80 and 64 bits respectively.

The key and IV are feed to the cipher one bit each (enabled) clock, 
after that the [INIT_I] signal has been asserted for one (enabled)
clock cycle:



CLK_I      /--\__/--\__/--\__/--\__/--\__/--\__/--\__/--\__
CLKEN_I    /-----\_____/-----\_____/-----\_____/-----\_____

INIT_I     /------\________________________________________

KEY_I      --------< K0      >< K1       >< K2     ....
IV_I       --------< IV0     >< IV1      >< IV2    ....

(here we assume that clock is enabled every other cycle)


After 64 (enabled) clock cycles, the IV has been fed to the cipher.
16 clock cycles later, the key has also been fed to the cipher. 
At this point, the user should simply wait for the output.





3. OUTPUT:
----------

At some point after initialization, the keystream will start to appear
on the [KEYSTREAM_O] output at the same time the signal
[KEYSTREAM_VALID_O] will be asserted. 

This output sequence works as following:


CLK_I              /--\__/--\__/--\__/--\_...._/--\__/--\__/--\__/--\__
CLKEN_I            /-----\_____/-----\____...._/-----\_____/-----\_____

INIT_I             /------\_______________...._________________________


KEYSTREAM_O        ##################################< KS0       >< KS1 ...
KEYSTREAM_VALID_O  ###################\___...._______/-------------- ...

The module will generate one bit of key stream for each enabled clock cycle.
(here we assume every other clock is enabled)





4. RE-INITIALIZATION:
---------------------

To change the key and/or IV, simply repeat the initialization procedure.

Beware however that the keystream from the old key/IV pair will be 
produced up to one clock cycle after [INIT_I] has been re-asserted.

Notice also that you are not allowed to re-start the initialization
sequence before it has finished. The initialization sequence is finished
when [KEYSTREAM_VALID_O] is asserted.





5. GRAIN-128:
-------------

The Grain-128 IP works in the same way. The only difference is that key size 
is increased to 128 bits and IV size is increased to 96 bits.





6. SIMULATION:
--------------

Two testbenches are provided, one for Grain-1 and one for Grain-128. 
They both use testvectors from the original Grain papers.

A TCL script to compile and run each testbench from Aldec Riviera can 
be found under SRC/TCL. Notice that the this script will test both 
the slow and the fast datapaths.

If you have any doubts about the operation or timing of Grain, the 
simulation waveform is the best place to look ;)





7. SYNTHESIS:
-------------

Synthesis is straightforward. Just add the three (two) required files 
to your project and push the "synthesis" button :)


Beyond that, a couple of things that more advanced users may be 
interested in are:




7.1: CLOCK ENABLE:
The clock enable signal is a high-fan out signal. If you are using a 
"normal" signal as clock enable, make sure you at least have it 
registered once or twice before sending it to the IP. This will ease 
the effects of logic duplication that sure will be required :(



7.2 REGISTER BALANCING:
The feedback term used in the NFSR and the H function are really huge.
This will affect the maximum frequency negatively. Luckily, simple
register balancing techniques will fix this. The "fast" datapath is a
very simple (and naive) example on how this is done.

If your synthesis tool supports register balancing (e.g. ISE webpack),
I recommend that you use the "slow" datapath and turn on automatic 
register balancing within your tool instead. This will always give you 
a better (faster/smaller) result.



7.3 Xilinx, SRL16 and alike
Some academic folks seem to be in love with SRL16 and consider it the
best thing since sliced bread. But the thing is... if you insert FPGA 
primitives like these directly into your code, it will become
ARCHITECTURE DEPENDENT and not very PORTABLE.

And the most funny thing is that the synthesis tools are very good at 
automatically inferring SRL16 and alike from pure RTL code when/if 
needed. For this reason, you wont see any FPGA primitives in the 
grain code.



7.4 Actel and the pain of VersaTiles
This grain code becomes bid and slow on some Actel devices. This 
has probably to do with their cell architecture. I can look more into 
this if anyone is interested.
