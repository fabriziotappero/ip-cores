1. Known differences between w11a and KB11-C (11/70) ----------------------

   - the SPL instruction in the 11/70 always fetched the next instruction
     regardless of pending device or even console interrupts. This is known
     as the 'spl bug', see
       http://minnie.tuhs.org/pipermail/pups/2006-September/001082.html
       http://minnie.tuhs.org/pipermail/pups/2006-October/001083.html
     In the w11a the SPL has 11/70 semantics in kernel mode, thus next no 
     traps or interrupts, but in supervisor and user mode SPL really acts as 
     nop, so traps and interrupts are taken as for all other instructions. 
     --> The w11a isn't bug compatible with the 11/70.

   - A 'red stack violation' looses PSW, a 0 is pushed in stack.

   - The 'instruction complete flag' in SSR0 is not implemented, it is 
     permanently '0', SSR2 will not record vector addresses in case of a
     vector fetch fault. Recovery of vector fetch faults is therefore not
     possible, but only 11/45 and 11/70 supported this, no OS used that, and
     it's even unclear whether it can be practically used.

   - the 11/70 maps the 18 bit UNIBUS address space into the upper part of
     the 22bit extended mode address space. With UNIBUS mapping enabled, this
     allowed to access via 17000000:17757777 the memory exactly as a UNIBUS
     device would see it. The w11a doesn't implement this remapping, an access
     in the range 17000000:17757777 causes a NXM fault.

   All four points relate to very 11/70 specific behaviour, no operating system
   depends on them, therefore they are considered acceptable implementation
   differences

2. Known limitations ------------------------------------------------------

   - some programs use timing loops based on the execution speed of the
     original processors. This can lead to spurious timeouts, especially
     in old test programs.
     --> a 'CPU throttle mechanism' will be added in a future version to 
         circumvent this for some old test codes.

   - the emulated I/O can lead to apparently slow device reaction times,
     especially when the server runs as normal user process. This can lead
     to timeout, again mostly in test programs.
     --> a 'watch dog' mechanism will be added in a future version which
         suspends the CPU when the server doesn't respond fast enough.

3. Known bugs -------------------------------------------------------------

   - TCK-036 pri=L: RK11: hardware poll not working
     The RK11/RK05 hardware poll logic is probably no reflecting the
     behaviour of the real drive.

   - TCK-035 pri=L: RK11: no proper NXM check in 18bit systems
     No NXM error is generated when a RK11 read or write reaches the top 
     of memory in 18 bit addressing. Crash dump routines use this to detect
     end-of-memory.

   - TCK-032 pri=M: RK11: polling on DRY in RKDS doesn't work
     DRY in RKDS goes 1->0 immediately with RDY in RKCS when a function is
     started. In a real RK05 drive DRY went to 0 after a short delay. Some
     basic hardware tests are sensitive to this.

   - TCK-030 pri=L: CPU: SSR0 trap bit set when access aborted
     The 'trap bit' (bit 12: 10000) is set even when the access is aborted.

   - TCK-029 pri=L: CPU: AIB A bit set for all accesses
     The MMU trap condition isn't properly decoded
   
   - TCK-028 pri=H: CPU: interrupt and trap precedence
     In case of multiple trap, fault, or interrupt conditions the precedence
     isn't implemented correctly.

   - TCK-026 pri=L: CPU: src+dst delta added in ssr1 when same register
     The ssr1 content after a fault is logically correct in w11a, but
     different from 11/70.

   - TCK-025 pri=L: CPU: no mmu trap when bit9 clearing instruction traps
     In the 11/70 the instruction which affects mmu trap can cause a trap
     already, in w11a only the next instruction will trap.

   - TCK-014 pri=M: RK11: write protect action too slow
     Some simple RK11 drivers, especially in tests, don't poll for completion
     of a write protect command. Due to the emulated I/O this can cause errors.

   - TCK-007 pri=H: CPU: no trap-4 after emt on odd stack
   - TCK-006 pri=H: CPU: no yel-stack trap after jsr pc,nnn(pc)
   - TCK-004 pri=H: CPU: yel-stack by interrupt causes loop-up
   - TCK-003 pri=H: CPU: yel-stack by iot pushes two stack frames
     All four issues are caused by an incorrect implementation of the trap
     logic, which leads to a different precendence when multiple trap, fault,
     or interrupt occur.
