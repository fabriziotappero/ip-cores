## VHDL/Verilog IP Cores Repository

This branch contains the following VHDL/Verilog IP Code:

    Project name: complex_arithmetic_operations
    Project category: arithmetic_core
    Project branch: arithmetic_core_complex_arithmetic_operations

This whole github repository is huge and, since IP cores are stored in separate
branches, it is a good idea to just download the branch that you are interested
in. This branch can be downloaded with the git command.

    git clone -b arithmetic_core_complex_arithmetic_operations --single-branch https://github.com/fabriziotappero/ip-cores.git

A cool searchable index of the whole repo is available from www.freerangefactory.org.
