2008-09-29      Added T1 Niagara bridge and template designs

2008-09-25	GRUSBHC: To conserve power the core disables the RAMS more
		often on non-FPGA technologies

2008-09-25	GRUSBHC: Some signal names in the in and out types for GRUSBHC
		has changed. The reason is that not all signals were named 
		exactly	the same as in the UTMI+ specification. Also all UTMI+
		signals	are now present, even those which are always constant.
		Also the input ursti has been removed. See grip.pdf for more
		detailed information.

2008-09-25      GRUSBHC: The core is no longer located in library usbhc but 
		instead in library gaisler. In and out types of the core has
		changed from usbhc_in_type and usbhc_out_type to grusb_in_type
		and grusb_out_type respectively. The package file needed to
		instantiate the core has changed from grusbhc_pkg to grusb.
		See grip.pdf for more detailed information and an example of
		how to instantiate the core.

		Disabled all power-saving functionality when the mobile 
		generic is set to 0 in DDRSPA, SDCTRL and SDMCTRL

2008-09-18      GRUSBHC: Improve timing by latching AHB ERROR responses
                during first AMBA response cycle.

2008-09-18      GRFPU: Fix rounding of mantissa and exponent in round up, 
                round to zero, and round down for division and sqrt. 
                The core could also produce denormalized numbers when an 
                underflow occured in single precision division.

2008-09-02      I2CMST: Core did not perform clock synchronization and
                did not differentiate between master clock synchronization and
                slave clock stretch. Affects behavior in multi-master systems.

2008-09-01      GRUSBHC: Conserve power on non-FPGA technologies by disabling
                RAMs when a controller is idle. Added scan test support; 
                disable RAMs when in test mode and scan is enabled.

2008-08-08      GRUSBHC: The 'Port Enable/Disable Change' bit in the UHCI PORTSC
                register was set every time the 'Port Enable/Disable' bit 
                changed.

2008-08-08      GRFPU: Rounding of infinity always regarded infinity as created
                from finite operands and the result was thus determined by the 
                rounding rules for the overflow exception.

2008-08-01	LEON3: uncache byte access (LDUBA with ASI=1) could fail on 
		non-FT system without MMU.

2008-05-26	SPICTRL: Added 3-wire mode

2008-05-26	SPICTRL: Last SCK cycle could be short. Delay first SCK
		transition, when CPHA = 0, based on clock scaler setting to
