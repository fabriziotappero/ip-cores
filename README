Welcome to LogicProbe!


1) What is it?

LogicProbe is a very simple logic analyzer which can be run on
an FPGA in parallel with the "device under test". The analyzer
has a width of 128 data channels, and is 512 samples deep. It
has a trigger (i.e., it starts catching the channels when this
signal got active once), and a sample enable (i.e., it does only
sample the channels when this line is 1). It uses the block RAM
on the FPGA to store the samples in real-time. When the sample
buffer is full, it begins to transmit the samples through a UART
(also included in the code) over the serial line to a PC where
the sample values are stored in a file. A simple listing program
allows to view the samples as hexadecimal values.


2) How do I use it?

You simply have to instanciate the module described below and setup
the constraints file so that "serial_out" is connected to the transmit
data line of an RS232 connector (via appropriate level shifters, of
course). The line speed is fixed at 38400 bps; this should certainly
be made a parameter of the design in the next version. Connect a PC
to the other end of the serial line and run the "receive" program,
which stores the transmitted samples into a file. You can then use
the "display" program to examine the samples as hexadecimal numbers.

Here is the interface to the analyzer module:

module LogicProbe(clock, reset, trigger, sample, channels, serial_out);

    input clock;                // master clock, also used for sampling
    input reset;                // master reset
    input trigger;              // start sampling when this line is 1
    input sample;               // enable sampling when this line is 1
    input [127:0] channels;     // the data to be sampled
    output serial_out;          // serial line to the PC

4) What else do I need?

If you want to run the tests, you need a Verilog simulator (I used
Icarus Verilog) and a VCD wave viewer (I used GTK-Wave). If you want
to use the analyzer in an FPGA, you must synthesize it (I used Xilinx
ISE 14.5). And you need a C compiler, preferably on a Linux system,
to receive and display the sample values.


5) Has the analyzer been used outside the test case?

Yes, it was instrumental in finding an error in my 32-bit CPU
which prohibited even the first instruction fetch from memory.
Simulation was of no help; the error didn't show up there. As
it turned out, I used initialization statements, which of course
couldn't be synthesized - so the start conditions inside the FPGA
differed from those of the simulation.
