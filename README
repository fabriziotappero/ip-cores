Welcome to ECO32!

The ECO32 project was inspired by Jan Gray's three-part article
"Building a RISC System in an FPGA" which appeared in the March
through May 2000 issues of "Circuit Cellar - The Magazine for
Computer Applications". We are building a similar system with
a lot of enhancements.

ECO32 is a simple, fast 32-bit processor that runs C code, currently
without floating point operations. We want to execute some flavour
of UNIX on it, so it has got two operating modes (kernel/user) and
a memory management unit (paging with TLB support). The processor
was first simulated at the instruction set level, then at the HDL
level, and has finally been implemented in an FPGA.

We now have an ANSI-C compiler (LCC) and an assembler/linker
toolchain available, as well as an unpolished port of the
UNIX 7th Edition kernel.

If you have any questions (or are eager to contribute to this
project), don't hesitate to contact the ECO32 team by email to
