This is an OpenCores release of the XUM MIPS32 processor
from release 2.0 of the XUM project at the University of Utah.

This project provides all of the hardware and software needed to build
a MIPS32-compliant processor and several I/O peripherals all from scratch
and implement them on an FPGA. It contains a GCC- and binutils-based
cross-compiler toolchain to allow custom code to be compiled and run
on the hardware.
