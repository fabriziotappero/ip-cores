This is a beginner project.

All precautions (I know) was taken to provide a safe core.
I have tested and worked with this core on my DE1 board for months, and have
not caused any damaged to my equipment so far.

However, I decline any responsability of any kind for any damage you may cause to
you hardware when using this core.

If you find any unsafe code, or badly wrintten code, feel free to make the corrections.
In the case it is a important change, be kind and let me know:
