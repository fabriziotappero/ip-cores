Test Vectors
============

To make all the test vectors you need a program called 'pg'.
The included 'pg' is a Windows executable, build on a NT
system. If you need to compile your own 'pg' see the README
file in pg-src directory.

The script 'mkall' builds all test vectors and places them
in to the proper directories.

The script 'mkall_cfmp' builds all test vectors for FP compare
and places them in to the proper directories.

There are currently two types of tests:

1) Directed Test. This test, test a specific funstional unit
   and a specific rounding mode. They are located in  the
   directories rtne, rtzero, rup and rdown (Which represent
   the different rounding modes).

2) Completely Random Tests. Here the operation type and rounding
   mode are randomly selected and may change every cycle. This
   tests are located in the combo directory.

There are currently 14,808,684 FPU test vectors and 600,188 FP
compare test vectors!

WARNING: You need about 480Mb of disk space to build all test
vectors !!!
