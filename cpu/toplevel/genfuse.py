# This script generates a test include file from a set of "Fuse" test vectors.
#
# Three common testing configurations are:
#
# 1. You want to test a specific instruction only, say 02 LD (BC),A (see Fuse tests.in)
#    start_test = "02"
#    run_tests = 1
#    regress = 0
#
# 2. You want to run a smaller subset of 'regression' tests:
#    start_test = "00"
#    run_tests = 1
#    regress = 1
#
# 3. You want to run a full Fuse test suite (all instructions!):
#    start_test = "00"
#    run_tests = -1
#    regress = 0
