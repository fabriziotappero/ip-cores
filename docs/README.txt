===================

This is the README file for the Simply RISC S1 Core;
all the informations you need are contained in the text files
that you can find in the "docs" subdirectory:

  - README.txt        Summary (this file)

download a single PDF specification that is just a collection of
the text files included in the SVN tree and listed above.
