[msg_system]
; Change a message severity or suppress a message.
; The format is: <msg directive> = <msg number>[,<msg number>...]
; Examples:
;   note = 3009
;   warning = 3033
;   error = 3010,3016
;   fatal = 3016,3033
;   suppress = 3009,3016,3043
; The command verror <msg number> can be used to get the complete
; description of a message.

; Control transcripting of elaboration/runtime messages.
; The default is to have messages appear in the transcript and 
; recorded in the wlf file (messages that are recorded in the
; wlf file can be viewed in the MsgViewer).  The other settings
; are to send messages only to the transcript or only to the 
; wlf file.  The valid values are
;    both  {default}
;    tran  {transcript only}
;    wlf   {wlf file only}
; msgmode = both
